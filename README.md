### From Scratch — Create a Timed Coding Assessment Quiz
<br>

## Description

In this week's Challenge! I created a web application from scratch! A typical coding assessment; I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## My Work
I started with a blank page and a pencil, and I wireframed my HTML page. Immediately after, I wrote some of the pseudo logic code on the wireframe in order to mapout the flow. I then reviewed the modules as I built my first prototype. 

### My Initial PseudoCode
